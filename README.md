Todo:

reload path in onResume()

reset start pos when empty run with program.

horizontal center robot view.

--- nice to have do ---

tablet layout.

quad/splines for the paths.

new language: arrows

add a small 'droid' at the end of the path.

--- extras ---

Custom settings menu for width, height and start position. Only allowing
start position to be within the room, and possibly limiting the size of
